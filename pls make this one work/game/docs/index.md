## Rationale

OpenLearningQuest intends to supplement existing Open Educational Resources (OERs), such as Khan Academy, by creating a story-driven game where players are encouraged to apply their understanding of science and math to overcome in-game obstacles and challenges.

## Philosophy

At OpenLearningQuest, we believe learning should be playful, progressive, engaging, and self-guided.

### Playful

Learners should feel joy and have fun when exploring new concepts. While there may be some uncertainty, the learning environment should adapt to each learner's understanding and provide just enough challenge so they can successfully grow.

### Progressive

To the extent possible, learning should build on prior knowledge and experience. To that end, a curriculum should provide a natural progression of learning experiences and challenges. The learner should gain a sense of the expansiveness, divergence, and open-endedness of our emerging understanding.

### Engaging

We want OpenLearningQuest to feel like an adventure where the player feels naturally curious to take the next step in their learning journey. We employ narrative as a natural way to guide players along a learning quest.

### Self-guided

OpenLearningQuest intends to provide a game experience where players can make meaningful, self-guided decisions. We will support player decisions while providing opportunities to learn new concepts and skills. Players will choose their adventure in a rich, educational environment.
